let x = 10 ; // here = is assignment operator  and 10 is assigned to x variable 

// additions assignment -->

 x += 10 // is equal to x = x+10

 // Substraction assignemet operator

 x-=5 // is qual to x = x-5

 // multiplication assignement

 let y = 2

 y *=2 // equal to y = y * 2 
 
 // divisoin assignment

 y /=2 // equal to y = y/2

 // esctructuring assignemnt

const one = foo[0];
const two = foo[1];
const three = foo[2];
const four = foo[3];
